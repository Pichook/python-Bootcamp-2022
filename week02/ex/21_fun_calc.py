# Write a function in python fun_calc(num1, num2, operator) that receives 3 arguments
# (num1, num2 and operator). The first two arguments are operands (integers) and the third
# argument (character) that receives symbols of operators (+ (or) â€“ (or) * (or) /). The function
# should calculate and return the result to the caller and the type of operation must be
# defined with the third argument. The function should also print the result and also the
# calculation process.
